=== Session: 2025-12-12 (Setup) ===

COMPLETED:
- Integrated Playwright MCP for Claude Code CLI
- Created .claude/settings.json with Playwright config
- Created /project:verify command for single feature verification
- Created /project:verify-all command for batch verification
- Consolidated features.json with currentPhase tracking
- Updated init.sh with phase-aware file detection
- Added User Library feature set (9 new features)
- Created USER_LIBRARY_SPEC.md with full architecture
- Extracted shared SamplePanel component design
- Created skills/playwright-verification/SKILL.md
- Updated skills/agentic-development/SKILL.md with Playwright integration
- Updated roadmap.md with Phase 6 details and User Library

IN PROGRESS:
- None (clean state)

BLOCKERS:
- None

NEXT PRIORITY:
- p6-sample-panel-base: Shared base component for Sound Browser and User Library
  (HIGH priority, no dependencies, enables both browser tracks)

SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:
1. p6-sample-panel-base → Shared component
2. p6-sound-list → Sound Browser using SamplePanel
3. p6-user-library-button → Header integration  
4. p6-user-library-panel → User Library using SamplePanel
5. p6-panel-exclusivity → Mutual exclusion
6. Continue with search/preview/insert for both panels

GIT COMMITS THIS SESSION:
- (pending: phase-6-setup branch with all new files)

NOTES:
- Playwright MCP uses accessibility tree, not screenshots
- Verification steps map to Playwright actions via pattern matching
- Run `claude mcp add playwright` in project directory to enable
- Use --headless for CI, headed for debugging
- See docs/USER_LIBRARY_SPEC.md for User Library architecture
- See PLAYWRIGHT_MCP.md for verification setup
- Skills updated: agentic-development, playwright-verification (new)

=== Verification Workflow ===

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. In Claude Code: `/project:verify p6-sound-list`
3. Playwright navigates to localhost:5173
4. Each verification step executed and reported
5. On all-pass: features.json updated automatically
